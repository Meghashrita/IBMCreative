Quantum Iterference

Like a classical computer, a quantum computer operates on bits. However, while classical bits can only be found in the states 0 and 1, a quantum bit, or qubit, can represent the values 0 and 1, or linear combinations of both. These linear combinations are known as superpositions (or superposition states).

To see how this resource is utilized in quantum computation we first turn to a classical analog: noise cancellation. Noise cancellation, as done in noise cancelling headphones for example, is performed by employing superposition and the principle of interference to reduce the amplitude of unwanted noise by generating a tone of approximately the same frequency and amplitude.
